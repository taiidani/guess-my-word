<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is a pet project game around guessing a word based on its location in the alphabet. Users will provide a word, and the application will tell them if that word falls before or after the target in the alphabet. This process will then be repeated until the target is found. HINT: Think binary search trees!</p>
